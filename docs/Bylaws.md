**BYLAWS OF THE CA/BROWSER FORUM** 

**Version 1.4 - Adopted effective as of 4 April 2016**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


**1.  CA/BROWSER FORUM â€“ PURPOSE, STATUS, AND ANTITRUST LAWS**

**1.1        Purpose of the Forum:**

The Certification Authority Browser Forum (CA/Browser Forum) is a voluntary gathering of leading certification authorities (CAs) and vendors of Internet browser software and other applications.

Members of the CA/Browser Forum have worked closely together in defining the guidelines and means of implementation for best practices as a way of providing a heightened security for Internet transactions and creating a more intuitive method of displaying secure sites to Internet users.

**1.2        Status of the Forum and Forum Activities**

The Forum has no corporate or association status, but is simply a group of CAs and browsers which communicates or meets from time to time to discuss matters of common interest relevant to the Forum's purpose.  The Forum has no regulatory or industry powers over its members or others.  Other than those rights and responsibilities found in the Forum's Intellectual Property Rights Policy (IPR), Forum "membership" or other participation status does not convey any legal status or rights, but is intended simply as a guide to the levels of participation in Forum activities.

**1.3        Intellectual Property Rights Policy; Antitrust Laws and Regulations; Goal; Conduct**

Forum Members, Associate Members, and Interested Parties must comply with the then-current IPR policy and all applicable antitrust laws and regulations during their Forum activities.

The historic goal of Forum activities (including development of proposed requirements and guidelines and voting on all matters) has been to seek substantial consensus among Forum Members before proceeding or adopting final work product, and this goal will remain for the future.  Members shall not use their participation in the Forum either to promote their own products and offerings or to restrict or impede the products and offerings of other Members.

The Chair will read an antitrust compliance statement at the start of all Forum Meetings (and on other occasions, as the Chair deems necessary) in substantially the following form:

"As you know, this meeting includes companies that compete against one another. This meeting is intended to discuss technical standards related to the provision of existing and new types of digital certificates without restricting competition in developing and marketing such certificates. This meeting is not intended to share competitively-sensitive information among competitors, and therefore all participants agree not to discuss or exchange information related to:

(a) Pricing policies, pricing formulas, prices or other terms of sale;

(b) Costs, cost structures, profit margins,

(c) Pending or planned service offerings,

(d) Customers, business, or marketing plans; or

(e) The allocation of customers, territories, or products in any way."

(f)        Members fall into two categories: CAs (comprising issuing CAs and root CAs, as defined in the membership criteria) and product suppliers (as defined in the membership criteria). In order for the motion to be adopted by the Forum, two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the Members in the CA category must be in favor of the motion, and at least 50% plus one of the votes cast by the members in the browser category must be in favor of the motion  At least one CA Member and one browser Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted.

**3.  OTHER FORUM PARTICIPATION**

**3.1        Associate Members**

The Forum may enter into associate member relationships with other organizations when the CA/Browser Forum determines that maintaining such a relationship will be of benefit to the work of the Forum.

Participation as an Associate Member is by invitation only.  In order to become an Associate Member, an organization must sign a mutual letter of intent, understanding, or other agreement and the Forum's IPR Agreement, unless this latter requirement is waived in writing by the Forum based on overriding policies of the Associate Member's own organization IPR rules.  Associate Members may attend face-to-face meetings, communicate with Forum Members on member lists, and access Forum wiki content.  Associate Members are not entitled to vote except on special straw polls of the Forum (e.g. when selecting meeting dates, locations, etc.)

**3.2  Interested Parties**

Any person or entity that wishes to participate in the Forum as an Interested Party may do so by providing their name, affiliation (optional), and contact information, and by agreeing to the IPR Agreement attached as Exhibit A (indicating agreement by manual signing or digitally signing the agreement).

Interested Parties may participate in Forum activities in the following ways:

(a)        By becoming involved in Working Groups,

(b)        By posting to the Public Mail List, and

(c)        By participating in those portions of Forum Teleconferences and Forum Meetings to which they are invited by the Forum Chair relating to their areas of special expertise or the subject of their Working Group participation.

Interested Parties are required to comply with the provisions of the IPR Agreement and these Bylaws.  Interested Parties may lose their status as Interested Parties by vote of the Members, in the Members' sole discretion.



**3.3        Other Parties**

The public may follow the Forum's activities by reading all postings on the Public Mail List and the Public Web Site.  Questions or comments to the Forum may be sent to Questions Mail List.



**4.  OFFICERS AND FINANCES**

**4.1        Officers**

(a) Term of office:  The Forum will elect a Chair and Vice Chair, each to serve for a two-year term.  The Vice Chair has the authority of the Chair in the event of any absence or unavailability of the Chair, and in such circumstances, any duty delegated to the Chair herein may be performed by the Vice Chair.  For example, the Vice Chair will preside at Forum Meetings and Forum Teleconferences in the Chair's absence.  The offices of Chair and Vice Chair may only be filled by Forum Member representatives.

No person may serve as Chair for more than a two-year period or be elected to Vice Chair upon expiration or termination of the person's service as Chair, but a person is eligible to be elected as Chair again after having vacated the position as Chair for at least two years.

(b) Manner of conducting nominations:   At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the current Chair's term or upon his/her early termination as Chair, the Chair or Vice Chair will announce through the management mailing list that nominations are open for the office of Chair and the Vice Chair will automatically be nominated as the next Chair, but Forum Members may nominate themselves or others to be additional candidates as Chair.  A Vice Chair may decline the nomination to the office of Chair and/or indicate an intent to seek nomination for re-election to the office of Vice Chair.  The nomination period for Chair will last for at least one week but no longer than four weeks.  Upon the close of the nominations for Chair, the nomination period for the office of Vice Chair shall immediately open. The nomination period for Vice Chair will last for at least one week but no longer than four weeks.

(c) Manner of holding officer elections:   If a single individual is nominated for a position, the Forum will hold a ballot to confirm appointment of the nominee. For the confirmation ballot, each Forum Member is entitled to a single vote regardless of the number of participating Forum Member representatives or whether the Forum Member is categorized as a CA or product supplier. If multiple votes are received from a Forum Member's representatives, the last vote submitted during the voting period is considered the Forum Member's vote.  The single nominee is considered confirmed if a majority of the Forum members who vote are in favor of the appointment, regardless of the number of votes cast and irrespective of whether 2/3 of the CAs or 1/2 of the product suppliers approve appointment of the nominee.

If more than one candidate is nominated for Chair or Vice Chair, the Forum will announce an election ballot to determine which candidate will fill the position.  Within two weeks after the close of the nomination period, the Chair or Vice Chair will establish an election committee and announce the election ballot on the management mailing list along with the ballot start date, ballot end date, and a description of the voting process.  The Chair or Vice Chair will appoint the election committee by selecting at least two volunteers who have a reputation for independence, preferably individuals without voting rights in the Forum and that participate as Interested Parties.  The election committee is responsible solely for tallying Forum Member votes in connection with the election ballot. The description must include the email address(es) where members will send their vote, which should be the email addresses of the election committee.

For election ballots, each Forum Member is entitled to a single vote regardless of the number of participating Forum Member representatives or whether the Forum Member is categorized as a CA or product supplier. If multiple votes are received from a Forum Member's representatives, the last vote submitted during the voting period is considered the Forum Member's vote. Within two weeks after the election ballot closes, the election committee will compile the votes, ensure that only one vote is counted per Forum Member, confirm the results with other members of the election committee, and publish the ballot results by sending an email to the public mailing list.  The election committee will not include any votes submitted before or after the voting period when compiling the votes. The ballot results email will contain only the following information:

a short description of the ballot purpose, the total number of votes submitted during the ballot period, and the name of the nominee receiving the most votes. The election committee may include other language as necessary to accurately describe the ballot and any concerns the election committee had with the ballot, provided that such language does not disclose how individual Forum Members voted.  The election committee will treat the votes of individual Forum Members as confidential information.  The nominee receiving the most votes is appointed to the applicable position, regardless of the number of votes cast and irrespective of whether 2/3 of the CAs or Â½ of the product suppliers voted for the nominee. If the election ballot results in a tie among the candidates receiving the most votes, the Chair or Vice Chair will call for another election ballot that includes only the two tying candidates.

(d) Duties:  The Chair and Vice Chair shall exercise their functions in a fair and neutral manner, allowing all Members equal treatment for their comments and proposals, and shall not favor one side over another in any matter (except that the Chair and Vice Chair may indicate their own position during discussion and voting on the matter).  The Chair and Vice Chair shall have no personal liability for any activities of the Forum or its Members or Interested Parties.

The Chair or the Vice Chair may sign correspondence, applications, forms, Letters of Intent, and Memoranda of Understanding relating to projects with standards bodies, industry groups, and other third parties, but shall have no personal liability therefor.

**4.2        Finances**

Because the Forum has no corporate status, it will not maintain funds or banking accounts.  The costs of operating Forum websites or mailing lists will be covered by voluntary contribution from Forum Members (who may seek voluntary contributions from other Members to help defray such costs).  Forum Members may propose other group activities which they propose to sponsor (e.g., research projects, etc.) which require funding and may seek voluntary contributions from other Members for such activities.

Forum Meetings may be held from time to time upon the voluntary sponsorship of one or more Forum members.  The sponsor of a Forum Meeting may suggest a fixed cost per meeting participant as reimbursement to the sponsor to cover (a) the cost of meeting rooms and refreshments, and (b) the cost of any meeting dinner or other group activity.  Sponsors will be encouraged to announce any suggested per-participant fixed cost reimbursement amount in advance of the Forum Meeting for participant planning purposes, and will provide a statement or invoice to each participant upon request after the Forum Meeting for submission to the participant's accounting department.  All per-participant reimbursements shall be paid directly to the sponsor.

Interested Parties will not be required to pay anything for their participation in Forum activities, but must cover their own expenses for participation in any Working Group meetings.

**5.  FORUM ACTIVITIES**

Upon creation of a Working Group, the Forum will post an invitation to all Interested Parties to participate, and will solicit others with expertise and interest in the Working Group subject matter to become Interested Parties and participate in the Working Group.   With the approval of the Chair, Working Groups may establish separate list-servs, wikis, and web pages for their communications, but all such separate list-servs must be managed in the same fashion as the Public Mail List.  Working Groups may meet by teleconference or face-to-face meetings upon approval by the Chair and the Working Group Chair, but the Forum shall not be responsible for the expenses of any such teleconferences or meetings.

Working Groups may draft recommendations to be forwarded to the Forum for its consideration, but no recommendations will be considered the product of the Working Group unless approved by two-thirds of all Working Group members who vote on the recommendations.

The Forum shall review the final recommendations from a Working Groups and may approve and implement some or all of the recommendations as appropriate in the Forum's judgment following the Forum's regular voting rules. The Forum shall retain the right to amend a Working Group recommendation before approval, but in most cases should first return the proposed amended recommendation to the Working Group for its review and response before voting.

The Forum shall not be required to submit any matter to a Working Group, but may itself draft requirements and guidelines without a Working Group in its discretion.
